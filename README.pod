=head1 NAME

slot - Simple, efficient, comple-time class declaration

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Point;
  use Types::Standard -types;

  use slot x => Int, rw => 1, req => 1;
  use slot y => Int, rw => 1, req => 1;
  use slot z => Int, rw => 1, def => 0;

  1;

  my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 20);
  $p->x(30); # x is set to 30
  $p->y;     # 20
  $p->z;     # 0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Similar to the L<fields> pragma, C<slot> declares individual fields in a class,
building a constructor and slot accessor methods.

Although not nearly as full-featured as L<other|Moose> L<solutions|Moo>,
C<slot> is light-weight, fast, works with basic Perl objects, and imposes no
dependencies outside of the Perl core distribution. Currently, only the unit
tests require non-core packages.

C<slot> is intended for use with Perl's bare metal objects. It provides a
simple mechanism for building accessor and constructor code at compile time.

It does I<not> provide inheritance; that is done by setting C<@ISA> or via
the C<base> or C<parent> pragmas.

It does I<not> provide method wrappers; that is done with the C<SUPER>
pseudo-class.

It I<does> build a constructor method, C<new>, with support for default and
required slots as keyword arguments and type validation of caller-supplied
values.

It I<does> build accesor methods (reader or combined reader/writer, using the
slot's name) for each slot declared, with support for type validation.

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

C<slot> generates a constructor method named C<new>. If there is already an
existing method with that name, it may be overwritten, depending on the order
in which C<slot> was imported.

Because slots are declared individually, the constructor as well as the
accessor methods are generated on the first call to C<new>.

=head2 DECLARING SLOTS

The pragma itself accepts two positional parameters: the slot name and optional
type. The type is validated during construction and in the setter, if the slot
is read-write.

Slot names must be valid perl identifiers suitable for subroutine names. Types
must be an instance of a class that supports the C<check> and C<inline_check>
methods (see L<Type::Tiny/Inlining methods>).

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 rw

When true, the accessor method accepts a single parameter to modify the slot
value. If the slot declares a type, the accessor will croak if the new value
does not validate.

=head2 req

When true, this constructor will croak if the slot is missing from the named
parameters passed to the constructor. If the slot also declares a
L<default value|/def>, this attribute is moot.

=head2 def

When present, this value or code ref which returns a value is used as the
default if the slot is missing from the named parameters passed to the
constructor.

If the default is a code ref which generates a value and a type is specified,
note that the code ref will be called during compilation to validate its type
rather than re-validating it with every accessor call.

=head1 INHERITANCE

When a class declares a slot which is also declared in the parent class, the
parent class' settings are overridden. Any options I<not> included in the
overriding class' slot declaration remain in effect in the child class.

  package A;

  use slot 'foo', rw => 1;
  use slot 'bar', req => 1, rw => 1;

  1;

  package B;

  use parent -norequire, 'A';

  use slot 'foo', req => 1; # B->foo is req, inherits rw
  use slot 'bar', rw => 0;  # B->bar inherits req, but is no longer rw

  1;

=head1 DEBUGGING

Adding C<use slot -debug> to your class will cause C<slot> to print the
generated constructor and accessor code when C<new> is first called.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

C<slot> is designed to be fast and have a low overhead. When available,
L<Class::XSAccessor> is used to generate the class accessors. This applies to
slots that are not writable or are writable but have no declared type.

A minimal benchmark on my admittedly underpowered system compares L<Moose>,
L<Moo>, and L<slot>. The test includes multiple setters using a mix of
inherited, typed and untyped, attributes, which ammortizes the benefit of
Class::XSAccessor to L<Moo> and L<slot>.

  |           Rate   moo moose  slot
  | moo   355872/s    --  -51%  -63%
  | moose 719424/s  102%    --  -25%
  | slot  961538/s  170%   34%    --

Oddly, L<Moo> seemed to perform better running the same test without
L<Class::XSAccessor> installed.

  |           Rate   moo moose  slot
  | moo   377358/s    --  -50%  -56%
  | moose 757576/s  101%    --  -12%
  | slot  862069/s  128%   14%    --
